Initially planned as a basic Tkinter app for mathemathical visualisation of phi convergence series.

But, advancing it with more detailed CustomTkinter-based Graphical application that generates the Fibonacci sequence and computes the ratio of successive terms, illustrating their convergence toward the golden ratio (Ï†). 
It helps to visualize series behavior, and experiment with numerical convergence with details of every +1 steps.
